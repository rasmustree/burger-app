Have done a little on the file server.js and commitet it. The changes i did affected the different routes in the to-be website.
An example of an route is /burger etc. to prepare for later changes. I'll look more into node.js and try to learn a little more.
Have to tink about how we are to use the database to add different options to the different routes. After that we have to be able to 
have a checkout menu in the route /checkout/, with options to add and remove the different choices and also a /checkout/send/ which
confirms the order that you've added and sentds it to kitchenview.

I have changed the language from swedish to english for readability purposes. I'm sick this week (v.40) so I haven't done much
work. I will hopefully be able to catch up later on. To start working on the actual webapp I need to have access to the database somehow.
I will figure it out, hopefully, because frankly I have got no idea.
