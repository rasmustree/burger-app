We had a meeting about what has to be done within the app, i sat at the library and wrote down a couple of things

1. User opens the app
   front end send the request to fetch the menu
2. Fetching the menu
   front end : function starts app which will call menu
   server: listens for incoming requests on end point api
3. user orders burger
   frontend call order id when user clicks to order
4. Processing order
   frontend: send a POST request to server at api with burger ID
   server: Receives request and processes order
   Database: Server inserts new record into the order table within, 1. burgerID, 2. status "pending"
   respons: server retirms a confirmation message to frontend
5. Kitchten view
   Kitchen view send request to server for order
   server: listens for request and processes it
   Database: server queries orders table for records with status
   respons: server send list of pending orders to kitchen view for "preperation"
   We also made a document were we listed things that has to be done, in 3 catagories
   Done, working on it, todo.

We got together today and tried to fix so everyone had docker installed on their computer
I also learned what containers are, kinda, its used for the app to be compatible on multiple devices

## okt 10 2000

When we got together i tried to understand how to install the docker and tried it myself at home, had a few issues that resolved thanks to this thread "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-docker-engine". after reading the link i understood a few things, Docker and container isnt the same thing, docker is like container but for backend and container is used for front end, the meaning behind them are basicly the same, its for the app to work/look good on any machine/screen size.
