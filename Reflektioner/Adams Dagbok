We had a meeting about what has to be done within the app, i sat at the library and wrote down a couple of things

1. User opens the app
   front end send the request to fetch the menu
2. Fetching the menu
   front end : function starts app which will call menu
   server: listens for incoming requests on end point api
3. user orders burger
   frontend call order id when user clicks to order
4. Processing order
   frontend: send a POST request to server at api with burger ID
   server: Receives request and processes order
   Database: Server inserts new record into the order table within, 1. burgerID, 2. status "pending"
   respons: server retirms a confirmation message to frontend
5. Kitchten view
   Kitchen view send request to server for order
   server: listens for request and processes it
   Database: server queries orders table for records with status
   respons: server send list of pending orders to kitchen view for "preperation"
   We also made a document were we listed things that has to be done, in 3 catagories
   Done, working on it, todo.
