We had a meeting about what has to be done within the app, i sat at the library and wrote down a couple of things

1. User opens the app
   front end send the request to fetch the menu
2. Fetching the menu
   front end : function starts app which will call menu
   server: listens for incoming requests on end point api
3. user orders burger
   frontend call order id when user clicks to order
4. Processing order
   frontend: send a POST request to server at api with burger ID
   server: Receives request and processes order
   Database: Server inserts new record into the order table within, 1. burgerID, 2. status "pending"
   respons: server retirms a confirmation message to frontend
5. Kitchten view
   Kitchen view send request to server for order
   server: listens for request and processes it
   Database: server queries orders table for records with status
   respons: server send list of pending orders to kitchen view for "preperation"
   We also made a document were we listed things that has to be done, in 3 catagories
   Done, working on it, todo.

We got together today and tried to fix so everyone had docker installed on their computer
I also learned what containers are, kinda, its used for the app to be compatible on multiple devices

## okt 10 2000

When we got together i tried to understand how to install the docker and tried it myself at home, had a few issues that resolved thanks to this thread "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-docker-engine". after reading the link i understood a few things, Docker and container isnt the same thing, docker is like container but for backend and container is used for front end, the meaning behind them are basicly the same, its for the app to work/look good on any machine/screen size.

## okt 11 1300

Accedently deleted most of my work i did yesterady and got nothing to show for, but danne helped me fix it

## okt 11 1930

Trying to make so i can start the server and see the others work on the website but i keep getting "Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/usr/src/app/frontend_ordering/frontend_objects.html'" message

## okt 12 1600

Added change to directory for app.get in server.js
Tried to add docker files and .yaml to my kitchenview, started the server at port 8082 im getting and "forbidden error" need to search up what that means , as i understand it will still work to connect every port to eacheother but this is what i have done for now.

## okt 12 1900

Danne helped me change directory in the kitchen view port from 8000 to 5000
Changed the docker so it looks similar to the others, and just changed the port, still getting errors for now, but not the same error as before (forbidden error). Added package.json as it will become easier to build the kitchen view when its textbased in node.

## okt 12 2100

Made so kitchen view can be run in port 5000
had problems with setting up the docker and .yaml, but when i updated
docker compose up it worked

## okt 12 2320

Realised we didnt need a website for this to work could just do everything in the terminal for the kitchen view atleast. Still not going to deleted the html file, learned from it, and maybe going to need to use the api i added their if thats somthing we are going to use. Just made a simple js file to run at port5000 made sure it looked like server.js

## okt 13 1700

Tried to make a general compose-docker file but it didnt work, kept on getting an error that it couldnt read kitchenview image Dockerfile not found, but it had a dockerfile. so i uploaded what i made for now.

## okt 15 1700

multiple problems happend today, and thanks to Danne i got all of the problems to get fixed, apperantly i had menustore server up on my computer even when i shut down or reseted my pc it was still up but one of these command helped to remove it: "fuser 8080/tcp" "fuser -k 8080/tcp" "kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:8080)". that tooks 2 hours to find the fix and also when i would try to pull the main file then my system would say denied and that everything was deleted, so i just deleted it from my pc and redownloaded it from the github server again.

## okt 15 2300

Tried to go back to the docker system and tried adding a dockerfile, still wouldnt work so now i moved on to the api instead.
Trying to make an basic api using fetch following this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0.

## okt 16 0010

Almost crashed everything today, so i just reverted everything back to how it was.
Learnt how to force shutdown a server, see what server is up by "docker ps -a" learnt how to debug a container by checking "docker ps"

## okt 16 2320

Downloaded alot of npm files, wrote npm install, npm install axios, npm install express to both Burgerorderer and kitchenview, just tried to make so the docker in container folder would work, it finally worked somehow, the servers arent really opening corectly but i will check it soon why it wont start correctly.

## okt 16 0000

Saw that the surver could run at port 3000 so i changed in the container compose.yaml file that its is externally 8080 and internally 3000 and it worked. another error i would get is that the menustore wont open, but danne told me they didnt need it so i removed it and that worked too.

## okt 17 0130

Added a checkout.html file that should take the order and added the confirm so it matches the server.js and sends the order too kitchenview, made it easier to go back to the start page by just adding a button that would make so it send the user back to the start. removed the button in fronend_objects.html
Changed kitchenview to easier take orders, it doesnt work rightnow.
changed the frontend so it should save the order by using localstorage following this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem. doesnt really work right now
