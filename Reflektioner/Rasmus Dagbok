We met up and planned what to do. We decided to use javascript and react.js framework as well as node.js

We were supposed to have a meeting, however since Aldin was sick and Adam was late, we decided to delay it, I did however write 
the instructions in a flowchart and sent it in our discord server to make it easier to know what needed to be done.

We had a digital meeting since many were sick. We decided me, Aldin and HÃ¥wk are backend (generally), and Noah and Daniel are frontend

We found out we're not supposed to use react.js framework, so we will only be using nodejs for this project.

between now and previous entry, I have been learning about containers and databases, but nothing felt worth a whole entry, so I am mentioning it here.
with some assistance from a teacher, I set up a containerized database that connected to phpmyadmin which allowed me to fairly easily set up a database after learning the basics.

we had a meeting to decide who does what and we made a to do doing done in a google doc

we had a meeting during the lab session, during which I found out that I couldn't just move the database I had created, so I had to start over from scratch.
I did not figure out how to do it, but Aldin gave the advice to create it directly in the repository.

I could not figure out how to make the database in the repo. First I tried to export an image of the database to it, but I didn't succeed

I made a compose file to create a local database in the repo, which worked. I had to figure out how to translate the console commands I previously used
into compose format, but I succeeded and you could type open the database in the repo.
The way to do this is to cd burger-app/Containers/backend/MenuStore
then type docker compose up
