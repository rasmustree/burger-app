We were supposed to have a meeting, however since Aldin was sick and Adam was late, we decided to delay it, I did however write

We had a digital meeting since many were sick. We decided me, Aldin and HÃ¥wk are backend (generally), and Noah and Daniel are frontend

We found out we're not supposed to use react.js framework, so we will only be using nodejs for this project.
