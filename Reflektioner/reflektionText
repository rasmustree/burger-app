Configuration management is a way to keep track of a large project with many moving parts. It lets you se who has done what, where, and when.

A normal workflow for git entails copying the code in the repo, create a branch with 'git branch', clone the branch with 'clone' and change it locally. Then push it to the branch with 'git push' and finally merge to main with 'git merge'

• What went well?
	The server
	setting up bridge between containers
	frontend
	kitchen view went well
	working with github went well. Daniel could explain it to those who didn't know

• What went less well?
	The data base took an extreme amount amount of time to be finished, and even then we needed to manually import an sql dump file
	Docker took a lot of time to learn and it was hard to debug.
	

• How did you solve the issues? what could you do different?
	If we started working on the project earlier, we would've had much more time to fix theese issues
	The database was solved through testing, removing pieces of the compose bit by bit, as well as trial and error, since nothing online helped.

• What did you not manage to solve? Why not?
	changing all constants to sql queries. Mainly due to the database being finished so late, we didn't have enough time to fix it.
	We never ended up doing unit testing since we only got a lecture two days before the assignment was to be turned in.
