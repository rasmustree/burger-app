Vi kom fram till att vi skulle använda oss av vs code, node.js och react för frontend.

We assigned roles to each member in the team
Aldin: backend
Rasmus: backend
Adam: backend
Noah: frontend
Daniel: frontend

Updated node to latest version.

I created a simple server using node and express.


Merge between server and main branch.
